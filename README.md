## Description

*Halcyon* is a VR Climbing game where each climb is different, and each path narrates the story.
of a lost civilization.
Discover a VR climbing game designed to support psychological well-being, reintroduce verticality, and gently encourage upper-body motion in paraplegic users. Built around the simple arm raising done in climbing motions, this game allows the players to reclaim verticality. As they move, players regain not only physical mobility but a sense of progress, perspective, and presence.

The mountain of Halcyon may be vast and ancient, but it is no sterile monument. Layered with multiple levels, lives, jokes, grief, cave paintings and song, it expresses the final breaths of its forgotten people.

Through intuitive mechanic, the mountain invites players to climb without fear of falling. Grips are procedural, glowing softly as they respond to the playerâ€™s hands with color shifts and audio cues.

There is no danger, no falling, no failure. What remains is the act of moving forward, moving upwards, with the mountain beside you.

You will only progress towards the peak, towards betterment, tedious as it may be.

### Core Features
